        THE   HOBBIT </h1>
        <h3>Chapter I</h3>
        <b><i>An Unexpected Party </i></b></div>
      <p class="paragraph" id="paragraph1">
     <i>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the
      ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit
      down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. <br>
      It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass
      knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tubeshaped hall like a tunnel: a very
      comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted,
      provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit
      was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into
      the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many
      little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going
      upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes
      (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same
      floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side
      (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows
      looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river. <br>
      This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had
      lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them
      very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never
      had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would
      say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins
      had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may
      have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained-well, you will see whether he gained
      anything in the end. <br>
      The mother of our particular hobbit ... what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some
      description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they
      call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the
      bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. <br>
      There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps
them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come
blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are
inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow);
wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair
like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, goodnatured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have
twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying,
the mother of this hobbit - of Bilbo Baggins, that is - was the fabulous Belladonna Took,
one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived
across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in
other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife.
That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, - and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have
adventures. </i>
